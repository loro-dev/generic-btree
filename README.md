# Generic B-Tree

It’s a pure safe BTree that can be used to build your own special-purpose btree
data structure. It’s mainly developed to optimize the performance of Loro CRDT’s
components.

It can be used to build:

- Rope
- Run length encoding data structure
- RangeMap that uses range as its key
- BTreeSet & BTreeMap
